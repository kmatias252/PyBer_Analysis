# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of PyBer Analysis

Our objective for the PyBer analysis was to create a summary of the ride-sharing data by city type (suburban, urban, rural). We then use Pandas and Matplotlib to create a multi-line graph to display the total weekly fares for each city type and share the results of our analysis with the CEO. 

## Results

The results from the table below show that total rides/drivers have an inverse relationship with the average fare per ride/driver.  Urban cities which have the highest amount of total rides and total drivers while also having the lowest average fare per ride and average fare per driver. Meanwhile, rural cities have the lowest amount of total rides and total drivers while also having the highest average fare per ride and average fare per driver.

The results from the multi-line graph below show how the total fare by city fluctuate between January and April of 2019.  The total fare price across all city types (suburban, urban, rural) fluctuated and then spiked up towards the end of February. This is then followed  by a sharp decline at the start of March. The total fare price then fluctuates by city type in the month of March. In April, the total fare price for urban cities plateaued, suburban cities decreased and then had a sharp increase that continued through the balance of the month and lastly rural cities decreased throughout the balance of April.

## Summary

Based on our analysis, below is a summary of three business recommendations to the PyBer CEO for addressing any disparities among the total fare based on city type.

1. We can deduce that average fares are higher in suburban and rural cities compared to urban cities because with less population density comes less demand but also the spatial differences requires drivers/rides to be longer in suburban and rural cities compares to urban. The average fare price per ride and average fare price per driver has an inverse relationship with population density of the city. Therefore, PyBer should create incentives to attract more drivers in rural and suburban to generate more profit in an unsaturated market. 
2. There is opportunity to increase fares in urban cities considering they have the most total rides and total drivers yet have the lowest total fares compared to the other city types. The average fare per ride is between $6-$10 lower than suburban and rural cities and the average fare per driver is between $23-$38 lower than suburban and rural cities. 
3. Across all city types fare prices have a sharp decline between the end of February and the start of March. My recommendation would be to investigate this further to determine what is the dependent variable that is effecting the total fare price to decrease and establish initiatives to promote more rides and bring up fare prices during this time frame.
