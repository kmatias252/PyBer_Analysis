# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of PyBer Analysis

The objective of the PyBer analysis was to create a summary of the ride-sharing data by city type (suburban, urban, rural). We then use Pandas and Matplotlib  to create a multi-line graph to display the total weekly fares for each city type to share the results of our analysis with the CEO. 

## Results
Description of differences in ride sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type.
